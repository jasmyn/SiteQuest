SiteQuest is a fun way to increase website user engagement through gamification. This small plugin awards players for following links on your site. As they explore, they earn XP, which adds up to give them levels. Visual indicators change every level, and are fully customizable to match the look and theme of your site. The info panel is always handy, but folds away at a click. Visitors who do not wish to engage can collapse the panel and ignore it, while engaged users can enjoy the plugin.

Points scored per click, points per level, and total levels are easily customizable.

Uses jQuery, which must be included first. See demo site for setup example.
